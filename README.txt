This app provides an overview of US energy production and CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2020 by state and by energy source.
By selecting a year and an energy source, the user can view the energy production across the US states and view the top ranked
states in terms of the energy production and CO2 emissions. The two bar charts show the energy production by the energy source
and CO2 emissions by the energy source between 1990 and 2020 for a selected State or US-Total.
The user can interact with each visualization to explore the environmental impact of different energy sources 
or to obtain insights on how US energy production resources have changed in the past 30 years.

The datasets for this dash is gathered from the US Energy Information Administration website (https://www.eia.gov/).
I should also credit the “Charming Data” YouTube channel for providing helpful examples on Python Dash.

This dash is deployed from Heroku and is available at https://ashorakama705.herokuapp.com/
